        <p>SCENE I (Dorimene, Monsieur Jourdain, Dorante, two Male Musicians,
            a Female Musician, Lackeys)</p>

<h6 class="name dorimene">DORIMENE:</h6>
<p class="speech"> Why, Dorante, that is really a magnificent repast!</p>

<h6 class="name monsieur-jourrdain">MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6>
 <p class="speech">You jest, Madame; I wish it were worthy of being
    offered to you.</p> 
    <p class="direction">(All sit at the table).</p>

<h6 class="name dorante">DORANTE:</h6>
<p class="speech"> Monsieur Jourdain is right, Madame, to speak so, and he
obliges me by making you so welcome. I agree with him that the
repast is not worthy of you. Since it was I who ordered it, and
since I do not have the accomplishments of our friends in this
matter, you do not have here a very sophisticated meal, and you
will find some incongruities in the combinations and some
barbarities of taste. If Damis, our friend, had been involved,
everything would have been according to the rules; everything would
have been elegant and appropriate, and he would not have failed to
impress upon you the significance of all the dishes of the repast,
and to make you see his expertise when it comes to good food; he
would have told you about hearth-baked bread, with its golden brown
crust, crunching tenderly between the teeth; of a smooth,
full-bodied wine, fortified with a piquancy not too strong, of a
loin of mutton improved with parsley, of a cut of specially-raised
veal as long as this, white and delicate, and which is like an
almond paste between the teeth, of partridges complimented by a
surprisingly flavorful sauce, and, for his masterpiece, a soup
accompanied by a fat young turkey surrounded by pigeons and crowned
with white onions mixed with chicory. But, as for me, I declare my
ignorance; and, as Monsieur Jourdain has said so well, I only wish
that the repast were more worthy of being offered to you.</p>

<h6 class="name dorimene">DORIMENE:</h6>
<p class="speech"> I reply to this compliment only by eating.</p>

<h6 class="name monsieur-jourrdain">MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6>
<p class="speech"> Ah! What beautiful hands!</p>

<h6 class="name dorimene">DORIMENE:</h6>
<p class="speech"> The hands are mediocre, Monsieur Jourdain; but you wish
to speak of the diamond, which is very beautiful.</p>

<h6 class="name monsieur-jourrdain">MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6>
<p class="speech"> Me, Madame? God forbid that I should wish to
speak of it; that would not be acting gallantly, and the diamond is
a very small thing.</p>

<h6 class="name dorimene">DORIMENE:</h6>
<p class="speech"> You are very particular.</p>
<h6 CLASS="name monsieur-jourrdain">
MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6>
<p class="speech"> You are too kind...</p>

<h6 class="name dorante">DORANTE:</h6>
<p class="speech"> Let's have some wine for Monsieur Jourdain and for these
gentlemen and ladies who are going to favor us with a drinking
song.</p>

<h6 class="name dorimene">DORIMENE: </h6>
<p class="speech">It is marvelous to season good food, by mixing it with
music, and I see I am being admirably entertained.</p>

<h6 class="name monsieur-jourrdain">MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: </h6>
<p class="speech">Madame, it isn't..</p>

<h6 class="name dorante">DORANTE:</h6>
<p class="speech"> Monsieur Jourdain, let us remain silent for these
gentlemen and ladies; what they have for us to hear is of more
value than anything we could say.</p>
 <p class="direction">(The male singers and the woman
singer take the glasses, sing two drinking songs, and are
accompanied by all the instrumental ensemble.)</p>
